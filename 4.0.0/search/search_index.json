This is always trivially true for <code>append</code> operations, and this is conceptually simpler, so the example we will work with here is based on <code>append</code>. It is worth noting that all of the same arguments also apply to <code>update</code> as well though.</p> <p>By re-using data layer keys from the previous version, calls to <code>append</code> are as efficient as possible, as they do not need to read any of the data layer keys from the previous version. However, this can result in the data layer becoming fragmented, in the sense that data in the data layer is spread over a lot of small objects in storage, and this can have a negative performance impact on <code>read</code> operations.</p> <p>Consider a use case where a symbol with 10 columns, all of 8 byte numeric types, is appended to once per minute. This means that each day, 1,440 data layer segments are written, each with just 80 bytes of information in. Calling <code>read</code> for a days worth of data therefore requires 1,440 reads of these tiny data layer objects, which will be much less efficient than reading a single object of 115,200 bytes.</p> <p>We will soon be adding an API to perform exactly this operation, re-slicing data such that subsequent reads can be as efficient as possible, without harming the efficiency of existing <code>append</code> or <code>update</code> operations.</p>"},{"location":"technical/on_disk_storage/#symbol-list-caching","title":"Symbol List Caching","text":"<p>Speeding up listing symbols</p> <p>The below documentation details the architecture for the symbol list cache.</p> <p>It explains that to speed up <code>list_symbols</code>, simply run <code>list_symbols</code> through to completion frequently.  The cache is built on first run and compacted afterwards.  This will speed up <code>list_symbols</code> for all accessors of the library - not just the user that runs <code>list_symbols</code>. </p> <p><code>list_symbols</code> is a common operation to perform on an ArcticDB library. As this returns a list of \"live\" symbols (those for which at least one version has not been deleted), using the data structures described above, this involves:</p> <ul> <li>Loading a list of version reference keys in the library.</li> <li>For each version reference key:<ul> <li>Traverse the version key linked-list until either a live version is found, or it is established that all versions have been deleted.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>For many libraries, these operations will be quick enough. However, if there are millions of symbols, or if the first live version to be found for symbols is very far back in the version key linked-list, then this method can be prohibitively expensive.</p> <p>Therefore, ArcticDB maintains a cache of live symbols, such that the <code>list_symbols</code> call should always return quickly. This works by writing special atom keys into the storage that track when symbols are created or deleted, and the time that the operation happened. These Symbol List atom keys are of the form:</p> <ul> <li><code>&lt;library prefix&gt;/sl/*sSt*__add__*0*&lt;timestamp 1&gt;*&lt;content hash&gt;*&lt;symbol name&gt;*&lt;symbol name&gt;</code> - signifies that <code>&lt;symbol name&gt;</code> was created at <code>&lt;timestamp 1&gt;</code></li> <li><code>&lt;library prefix&gt;/sl/*sSt*__delete__*0*&lt;timestamp 2&gt;*&lt;content hash&gt;*&lt;symbol name&gt;*&lt;symbol name&gt;</code> - signifies that <code>&lt;symbol name&gt;</code> was deleted at <code>&lt;timestamp 2&gt;</code></li> </ul> <p>The operation to list symbols then involves:</p> <ul> <li>Read all of the symbol list atom keys for the library (this resolves to a <code>ListObjects</code> call with S3 storage).</li> <li>Separate the keys by the symbol they refer to being created/deleted.</li> <li>For each symbol:<ul> <li>Check if the most recent operation was a creation or a deletion.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Symbols for which the latest operation is a creation are then returned to the caller of <code>list_symbols</code>.</p> <p>Without any housekeeping, this process could lead to unbounded growth in the number of symbol list atom keys in the library. Even worse, many of these keys would contain redundant information, as we only care about the latest operation for each symbol. Therefore, whenever <code>list_symbols</code> is called by a client with write permissions on the library, if there are too many (500 by default, see the Runtime Configuration page for details on how to configure) symbol list atom keys, all of the information from these keys is compacted into a single symbol list atom key, and the old keys are deleted. For example, if there were 4 symbol list atom keys:</p> <ul> <li><code>&lt;library prefix&gt;/sl/*sSt*__add__*0*t0*&lt;content hash&gt;*symbol1*symbol1</code> Create \"symbol1\" at t0</li> <li><code>&lt;library prefix&gt;/sl/*sSt*__delete__*0*t1*&lt;content hash&gt;*symbol1*symbol1</code> Delete \"symbol1\" at t1</li> <li><code>&lt;library prefix&gt;/sl/*sSt*__add__*0*t2*&lt;content hash&gt;*symbol12*symbol2</code> Create \"symbol2\" at t2</li> <li><code>&lt;library prefix&gt;/sl/*sSt*__add__*0*t3*&lt;content hash&gt;*symbol1*symbol1</code> Create \"symbol1\" at t3</li> </ul> <p>They would be compacted into a single object stating that \"symbol1\" and \"symbol2\" were both alive at time t3. The key for this object is of the form <code>&lt;library prefix&gt;/sl/*sSt*__symbols__*0*t3*&lt;content hash&gt;*0*0</code>.</p> <p>Astute observers will correctly take issue with basing logical decisions on timestamps in a purely client-side database with no synchronisation between clocks of different clients enforced. As such, this cache can diverge from reality, if two different clients create and delete the same symbol at about the same time, and this is the most likely cause of odd behaviour such as <code>lib.read(symbol)</code> working, but <code>symbol in lib.list_symbols()</code> returning <code>False</code>. If this happens, <code>lib.reload_symbol_list()</code> should resolve the issue.</p>"},{"location":"technical/releasing/","title":"Release Tooling","text":"<p>This document details the release process for ArcticDB.
